                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU
General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any
other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your
programs, too.

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use 
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which 
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
